# Genetic Algorithms
- Researched and completed a dissertation on an interactive web-app designed to teach Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to University students.
- Utilised SvelteKit to implement features such as a Monaco-powered editor for user-defined functions, real-time GA simulation, and a live-updating reactive graph displaying the algorithmâ€™s progress.
- Enhanced personal understanding of GAs through the development of a customisable, user-friendly tool for university lecturers and their students.
